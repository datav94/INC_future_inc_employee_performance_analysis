    "\n",
    "#### __Dataset Description__\n",
    "- The dataset provided is a dataset of employees of a ficticious company named INC Future Inc. The CEO of the company Mr.Brain decides to perform an analysis and come up with a machine learning model that is trained to predict an employee's performance based on the features provided. The data set contains ordinal, nominal and numerical values as features and the target variable i.e Performance rating is again an ordinal variable.\n",
    "#### __The following are the project goals:__\n",
    "    1. Department wise performance \n",
    "    2. Three most important features \n",
    "    3. A trained machine learning model to predict the target variable\n",
    "    4. Recommandations to imporve employee performance based on analysis and inferences\n",
    "- The data set is a structured labelled dataset containing 1200 records and 27 features and a target variable in total\n",
    "- Feature count suggests that 11 of these features are quantitative and 16 of these features are qualitative features\n",
    "#### __Analysis techniques used:__\n",
    "    - Distribution analysis - pandas and kernal density estimate plots\n",
    "    - Correlation analysis - heatmaps\n",
    "    - Analysis by visualization - univariate analysis using pandas profiling and bivariate analysis\n",
    "#### __Data Processing:__\n",
    "    - One hot encoding has been performed on the categorical  features using pandas get_dummies() method\n",
    "    - The dataset was imbalanced as seen from the value_counts() of the target variable \n",
    "    - A combination of SMOTE and RandomUnderSampling has been used to give a better balanced dataset without falling into the traps or cons of simpling over sampling or undersampling the data\n",
    "    - Feature and target splits have been performed by using pandas .iloc for data slicing\n",
    "    - Training and validation split were preformed usign sklearn's train_test_split\n",
    "#### __Machine learning:__\n",
    "    - After preprocessing the data the cross validation has been performed on each of the supervised machine learning algorithms namely Logistic regression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Classifier, XGBoostClassifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours and an unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-means clustering. The validation score evidently gave out __GradientBoostingClassifier__ and __XGBClassifier__ to be the best performing algorithms\n",
    "    - Hyperparmeter tuning was done on both of the above chosen ML models using RandomizedSearchCV and an accuracy of 91% was achieved although a higher compute using GridSearchCV would give much better results for future reference\n",
    "#### __Important Features:__\n",
    "    - The top three important features were chosen by using RandomForestClassifier and train the model and then using its .feature_importance_ attribute once the model has been trained to gather insight on which features have the highest predictive value\n",

    "5. The mean hourly rate is __65.98__ with most of the employees earning between the range of 60 to 95\n",
    "6. The most common job involvement rating is 3 i.e. __high__ so the employees at this company have a good Job Involvement rate\n",

    "## Analysis through visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bivariate and multivariate analysis is a little bit tricky and requires some work as compared to univariate analysis. Seaborn to the rescue here. we have used seaborn libraries kernal density estimate plots (kdeplots) to visualize and understand the distribution of one feature with another or in other words to visualize a correlation between two features.\n",
    "- From the data set it is evident that the numerical features have a comparatively high predictive value and hence yet again we invoke seaborn libraries heatmap function to create a heatmap that details out the correlation of each numerical feature including the target with other features which gives out a pretty good idea on the predictive value of each feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### __ Using kernal density estimate and line plots__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kernal Density estimate plots can be relatively tough to read but to simply they draft out the cumulative distribution of features and we have added a color palette to each of these to make these visualizations look more familier as they now resemble the heat signature plots. The following are the inferences gathered using kdeplots and line plots\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The better the employee's worklife balance the better he/she performs\n",
    "2. Trainings should be kept at a moderate amount as a very high amount of training is resulting in reducing employee performance\n",
    "3. The Employee relationship should be kept in control and not very low or very high as that affects the performance rating of the employee\n",
    "4. The higher the environment satisfaction the higher is the employee performance \n",
    "5. Employees with salary hike above 20 % tend to have a drastic increase in their performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### __ Using Heatmap and Pearson's Correlation __\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seaborn library's Heatmap by default uses pearson's correlation i.e. standard correlation to calculate the correlation of each numerical feature with another. The following are the inferences gathered from our analysis of the same\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The better the employee's worklife balance the better he/she performs\n",
    "2. Trainings should be kept at a moderate amount as a very high amount of training is resulting in reducing employee performance\n",
